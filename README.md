### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nba-dex.git
cd nba-dex
```

### 2. Set up Python environment

#### Windows

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.8 or higher
```

#### macOS/Linux

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Verify Python version
python3 --version  # Should be 3.8 or higher
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
# Upgrade pip to latest version
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

### 1. Basic Usage

```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate

# First, generate the players list
python get_available_players.py

# Then run the main application
python player_career_log.py
```

### 2. Interactive Mode

When running `player_career_log.py`, follow these steps:

1. Enter player name when prompted

   ```bash
   Enter player name: LeBron James
   ```

2. Wait for data processing

   ```bash
   Fetching data for LeBron James...
   Processing career statistics...
   ```

3. Check output directory for CSV file
   ```bash
   # File will be named: lebron_james_career_log.csv
   ```

### 3. Command Line Options

```bash
# Specify output directory
python player_career_log.py --output ./data

# Get data for specific seasons
python player_career_log.py --player "LeBron James" --seasons 2020-2023

# Export in different format
python player_career_log.py --format json

# Get help
python player_career_log.py --help
```

### 4. Batch Processing

Create a text file (`players.txt`) with player names:

```text
LeBron James
Stephen Curry
Kevin Durant
```

Then run:

```bash
python player_career_log.py --batch players.txt
```

### 5. Error Handling

If you encounter errors:

1. Player not found

   ```bash
   # Try using partial name
   Enter player name: Curry
   # System will show matching players
   ```

2. Rate limiting

   ```bash
   # Wait 60 seconds and try again
   # Or use the --delay option
   python player_career_log.py --delay 2
   ```

3. Connection issues
   ```bash
   # Check your internet connection
   # Try again with --retry option
   python player_career_log.py --retry 3
   ```

### 6. Output Format

The generated CSV will include:

```csv
Season,Team,Games,GamesStarted,MinutesPlayed,...
2003-04,CLE,79,79,3122,...
2004-05,CLE,80,80,3388,...
```

### 7. Monitoring Progress

1. Check the terminal for progress messages
2. Look for success confirmation:
   ```bash
   ‚úÖ Data successfully exported to: lebron_james_career_log.csv
   ```

### 8. Cleaning Up

```bash
# Deactivate virtual environment when done
deactivate

# Remove generated files (optional)
rm *.csv
rm available_players.txt
```

### 9. Tips for Best Results

- Keep the virtual environment activated while running scripts
- Use full player names for best matches
- Check `available_players.txt` for correct player names
- Wait a few seconds between requests for different players
- Keep your Python packages updated
